Apache Livy is an open source REST interface for interacting with
[Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org) from anywhere. It supports executing snippets of code or
programs in a Spark context that runs locally or in
[Apache Hadoop YARN](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/YARN.html).

* Interactive Scala, Python and R shells
* Batch submissions in Scala, Java, Python
* Multiple users can share the same server (impersonation support)
* Can be used for submitting jobs from anywhere with REST
* Does not require any code change to your programs

## Online Documentation

Guides and documentation on getting started using Livy, example code snippets, and Livy API
documentation can be found at [livy.apache.org](https://livy.apache.org).

## Before Building Livy

To build Livy, you will need:

Debian/Ubuntu:
  * mvn (from ``maven`` package or maven3 tarball)
  * openjdk-8-jdk (or Oracle JDK 8)
  * Python 3.x+
  * R 3.x

Redhat/CentOS:
  * mvn (from ``maven`` package or maven3 tarball)
  * java-1.8.0-openjdk (or Oracle JDK 8)
  * Python 3.x+
  * R 3.x

MacOS:
  * Xcode command line tools
  * Oracle's JDK 1.8
  * Maven (Homebrew)
  * Python 3.x+
  * R 3.x

Required python packages for building Livy:
  * cloudpickle
  * requests
  * requests-kerberos
  * flake8
  * flaky
  * pytest


To run Livy, you will also need a Spark installation. You can get Spark releases at
https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html.

Livy requires Spark 3.0+. You can switch to a different version of Spark by setting the
``SPARK_HOME`` environment variable in the Livy server process, without needing to rebuild Livy.


## Building Livy

Livy is built using [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org). To check out and build Livy, run:

```
git clone https://github.com/apache/livy.git
cd livy
mvn package
```

You can also use the provided [Dockerfile](./dev/docker/livy-dev-base/Dockerfile):

```
git clone https://github.com/apache/livy.git
cd livy
docker build -t livy-ci dev/docker/livy-dev-base/
docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd):/workspace -v $HOME/.m2:/root/.m2 livy-ci mvn package
```

> **Note**: The `docker run` command maps the maven repository to your host machine's maven cache so subsequent runs will not need to download dependencies.

By default Livy is built against Apache Spark 4.1.2 with Scala 2.13, but the version of Spark used when running
Livy does not need to match the version used to build Livy. Livy internally handles the differences
between different Spark versions.

The Livy package itself does not contain a Spark distribution. It will work with any supported
version of Spark without needing to rebuild.

### Build Profiles

| Flag           | Purpose                                                                            |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| -Phadoop2      | Choose Hadoop2 based build dependencies                                            |
| -Pthriftserver | Build and test Livy Thrift Server modules                                          |
| -Pspark3       | Choose Spark 3.x based build dependencies (use with `-Pscala-2.12`)                |
| -Pscala-2.12   | Choose Scala 2.12 based build dependencies (use with `-Pspark3`)                   |

Example — build against Spark 3:

```
mvn package -Pspark3 -Pscala-2.12
```

> **Note**: The default build targets Spark 4.1.2 and requires JDK 17 or JDK 21 with Scala 2.13 and Hadoop 3.4.1.
> JDK 8, JDK 11 and Scala 2.12 are not supported by Spark 4. Supported Python
> versions for Spark 4.1 are 3.10 – 3.14.
